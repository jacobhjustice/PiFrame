# PiFrame for Rasberry Pi
### What is PiFrame?
PiFrame is a photo frame application, designed to run on the Rasberry Pi. I have wanted to build something with a Pi for a while, so decided I'd make something sentimental for my fiancee's 21st birthday.

### Shopping List
You will need a few supplies. You can look around for better deals on different products, or go for a bigger screen, but here is what I used:
- Rasberry Pi Zero W
- 8 GB micro SD card 
- 7 inch touchscreen for Rasberry Pi
- 1 HDMI cable
- 1 HDMI to microHDMI convertor
- 2 microUSB cables
- 1 USB to microUSB convertor

### Setup
Step 1) Download Raspbian following instructions here: https://thepi.io/how-to-install-raspbian-on-the-raspberry-pi/

### Developer Manual
PiFrame was meant to be built upon!
Every feature within the application is called an `extension`. These extensions are made to be able to be turned on/off, and to function independantly of each other! This is great because that means any features you don't want to use can be disabled, ignored, or even removed. Even better, this methodology allows for more extensions to easilly be added! 

Every extension has three things in common: they are organized, persistent, and *always* on time! 
- *Organized*:
- *Persistent*:
- *On time*:

# Piframe for Rasberry Pi
### What is PiFrame?
PiFrame is a photo frame application, designed to run on the Rasberry Pi. I have wanted to build something with a Pi for a while, so decided I'd make something sentimental for my fiancee's 21st birthday.

### Shopping List
You will need a few supplies. You can look around for better deals on different products, or go for a bigger screen, but here is what I used:
- Rasberry Pi Zero W
- 8 GB micro SD card 
- 7 inch touchscreen for Rasberry Pi
- 1 HDMI cable
- 1 HDMI to microHDMI convertor
- 2 microUSB cables
- 1 USB to microUSB convertor
